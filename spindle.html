        A "spindle" in the context of a hard drive refers to the central shaft around which the disk platters rotate. In traditional mechanical hard drives, the data storage platters are mounted on this spindle and spin at high speeds (typically 5400, 7200, or 10,000 revolutions per minute) while the read/write heads move across the surface to access or store data. The spindle motor is responsible for spinning the platters at the required speed. The term "spindle" is often used interchangeably with "spindle motor" or simply "motor" when discussing hard drive components.</p>
