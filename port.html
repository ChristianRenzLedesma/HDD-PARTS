        The term "power port" typically refers to a physical connector on a device where you can connect a power source. In the context of electronics, including devices like hard disk drives (HDDs), a power port is where you plug in a power cable or adapter to provide electrical power to the device. This power is essential for the device to function. For an HDD, the power port is where you would connect the power cable from your computer's power supply unit (PSU) or an external power adapter to provide the necessary electricity for the HDD to operate and perform read and write operations on data.</p>
