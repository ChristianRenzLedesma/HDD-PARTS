    <p class="lorem">The term "circuit board" refers to a thin board made of a non-conductive material (such as fiberglass or plastic) on which electronic circuits are mounted and connected. These circuits are typically made up of conductive pathways, such as copper traces, which allow electricity to flow between various electronic components that are soldered or otherwise attached to the board.</p>
