    <p class="lorem">the term "disk" typically refers to the magnetic disk platters where data is stored. A hard drive may have one or more disks, depending on its capacity and design. Each disk is divided into tracks and sectors where data is stored. These disks are mounted on a spindle and spin at a high speed while the read/write heads read or write data on them. So, "disk" in the context of a hard drive refers to the physical platters where data is stored.</p>
